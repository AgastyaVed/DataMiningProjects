This ntebook shows a progressive approach to application of Machine Learning techniques. Along the way, the limitation and additional data conditioning required for analysis for each of the mehtods to improve scores are also shown.
Steps: 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Missing values imputation
3. Handling of categorical data
4. Logistic regression
5. SVM (Linear classifier)
6. Class balancing
7. Standard scaling
8. Dimensionality reduction
